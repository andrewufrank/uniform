The components must build on the existing base\ntools:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\tightlist\n\\item\n  ghc compiler\n\\item\n  cabal and stack to manage packages and link them together\n\\item\n  git for versioning and storage management\n\\item\n  VScode, for editing and visualizationThis is a minimal Haskell project\n  with a library and some routines which all do nothing.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nI used it for experimenting with data types, but the interest here is\nthe integration with a Haskell IDE, namely the use of ghcide with\nVScode."
