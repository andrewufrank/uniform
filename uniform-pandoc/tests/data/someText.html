<h1 id="an-new-start-for-an-ide-for-haskell">An new start for an IDE for Haskell</h1>
<p>The current theorie is to combine components to achieve an Integrated Development Environment. The components must build on the existing base tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>ghc compiler</li>
<li>cabal and stack to manage packages and link them together</li>
<li>git for versioning and storage management</li>
<li>VScode, for editing and visualizationThis is a minimal Haskell project with a library and some routines which all do nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>I used it for experimenting with data types, but the interest here is the integration with a Haskell IDE, namely the use of ghcide with VScode.</p>
